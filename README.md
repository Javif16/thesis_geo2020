# thesis_geo2020
This repository includes all the code and necessary work used during my thesis project for the Geomatics master thesis 2025.
The project consists of using thermal imagery to differentiate rock and soil types with the help of different deep learning techniques, such as CNN and RNNs or a combination of both. With this apporach, rocks and soil classification can be achieved in a fast and automated way through the analysis of thermal attributes over time and in different environmental factors.
